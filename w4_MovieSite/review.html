            <h2><b>REVIEW</b> <em>Black Hawk Down</em></h2>

            <p><b>Ben Roseberry</b> <i>August 10, 2023</i></p>

            <p>My review of one of the best war movies ever made. <em><b>Black Hawk Down</b></em> is a war movie directed by Riddly Scott, made a moddern warfare movie so good. Now there are alot of good war movies out there, but personally this one takes the cake. The cast of stars to touch this movie were briiliant, Ewan McGregor, Tom Hardy, Orlando Bloom, William Fitcher, and so many more unforgetable names played in this movie and absolutly killed the roles they played. The Amazing cinematography that pulls you in. The action sequence was so thrilling and ground breaking that it feels like an adrenaline rush. The sound track in this movie is just as incredible as the movie itself. Hans Zimmer took this movie to the moon with the collection of songs and tracks he put into this film. Certainly a must watch movie. I would give this movie a 10/10 ive seen it about 12 times and I'm still satified with how its written and directed each time I watch it. Yes its rated R but its a war movie its to be expected.  </p>
