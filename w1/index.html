    <h2>Paragraph Tag</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Ben, I come from a city in Massachusettes called Fall River, I was born there and lived there for about 12.5 years before I moved to Somerset, MA.I now live in Westport, MA. I really enjoy the sport of Hockey, my favorite team is the San Jose Sharks, and the Ottawa Senators I grew up with family members who loved hockey and it rubbed off on me. Im 20 years old but in less then two months I'll be 21, I can't wait. In my free time I like to go to the gym and play video games, some of the games I like to play with  friends are Escape from Tarkov, call of duty, NHL, Valorant, and many more. I consider games a hobby and a positive past time to keep myself out of trouble and keep me busy with my friends. I graduated from highschool in 2021 but I should have graduated in 2020 due to the fact that my brthday is one day after the birthday cut. I took a two year break from school until one day my landlord told me about this school, and how he graduated from the Cybersecurity field from here. I hope my next three years are filled with good information twords the field, also i hope to leave here and get into a stable, healthy, and fruitful career.  </p>
